            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I was born in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1983, to parents who instilled in me the values of resilience and determination. 
                My father, a dedicated military serviceman, played a pivotal role in shaping who I am today. His unwavering commitment 
                to providing for and raising my brother and me taught me the importance of perseverance and focus, even in challenging times. 
                These lessons have guided me throughout my personal and professional journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                After graduating high school, I enlisted in the United States Air Force, where I served with distinction as part of the 509th Munitions Squadron. 
                My time in the military not only sharpened my leadership and problem-solving skills but also fueled my interest in technology and innovation. 
                Following my honorable discharge, I transitioned into the vacation rental management industry, where I developed a strong appreciation for 
                data analysis and system optimization.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science at Florida A&M University, with a focus on data analytics and cloud computing. 
                My academic journey reflects my passion for technology and my desire to leverage it to solve real-world problems. Inspired by trailblazers in both technology 
                and my cultural heritage, I aim to use my skills to contribute to advancements in the tech industry while also mentoring the next generation of innovators.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of my studies, I enjoy exploring new technologies, hunting, fishing, and spending quality time with my family. As a proud father of four, I am especially inspired 
                by my daughters, who are also excelling in their academic pursuits at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Faith, family, and a commitment to lifelong 
                learning are the cornerstones of my journey, and I strive to lead a life that blends purpose, innovation, and service.
